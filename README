An operational transform library for Dart.

dart-collab allows multiple clients to edit a single document concurrently. The library provides
message, operation, document, server and client classes used to built a collaborative editing
system.

dart-collab is in a very early stage and is not documented or tested. There are rough edges and
many changes are coming soon. Currently only text documents are supported, but the plan is to add
arbitrary JSON-like document support soon, as well as the ability for developers to register their
own operations and transform functions.
